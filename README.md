This is a JavaScript password generator. In the application itself you are presented with a series of options for password criteria in which you could select what criteria to include. One of the options for password criteria to include, is that when deciding the length of the password...you could choose a length of at least eight characters and no more than 128 characters. Another option is for character types to include in the password, you could choose uppercase, numeric, special characters, and lowercase only(if no checkboxes are selected). A third option also is, when checking individual, or all boxes at the same time, and pressing the generate a password button right after...your input is validated. One last feature is when the password is generated it is written to the page.
